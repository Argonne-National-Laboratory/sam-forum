## SAM
[SAM](https://www.anl.gov/nse/system-analysis-module) is a modern system analysis tool being developed at [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov) for advanced non-LWR safety analysis.  It aims to provide fast-running, whole-plant transient analyses capability with improved-fidelity for various advanced reactor types including liquid-metal-cooled, molten-salt cooled and fueled, gas-cooled, and heat-pipe-cooled reactors. SAM takes advantage of advances in physical modeling, numerical methods, and software engineering, to enhance its user experience and usability. It utilizes an object-oriented application framework ([MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov)), and its underlying meshing and finite-element library ([libMesh](https://libmesh.github.io)) and linear and non-linear solvers ([PETSc](https://petsc.org/)), to leverage  modern advanced software environments and numerical methods.

Note that SAM source code is not available through this GitHub repository. Please contact your organization's SAM technical point of contact for more information regarding access to SAM.

## MOOSE

The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment ([MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov)) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework primarily developed by [Idaho National Laboratory](http://www.inl.gov). As SAM is built on the MOOSE framework, the prerequisites for a new installation from SAM source can be found at [MOOSE Getting Started](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/index.html).

In addition, any questions pertaining to the MOOSE framework or tools can may be posted over at the [MOOSE GitHub Discussions Forum](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions).
